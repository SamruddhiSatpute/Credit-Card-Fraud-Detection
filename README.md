# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains transaction details such as type, amount, and sender/receiver balances, with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraud or genuine. During preprocessing, missing values were handled, categorical features like transaction type were one-hot encoded, and numerical features were scaled for consistency. A machine learning pipeline was built using Logistic Regression as the classifier, combining preprocessing and model training in a single workflow. The data was split into training and testing sets, and the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. This approach helps in automatically classifying transactions as fraudulent (1) or genuine (0), assisting financial institutions in reducing losses due to fraud.
